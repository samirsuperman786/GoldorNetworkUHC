# GoldorNetworkUHC

So I have officially retired this project as of 7/30/2016. As such, I am making this public and offering all my source code in this
repository for anyone to freely use.

Good luck!

# What is GoldorNetworkUHC?

Goldor Network UHC is a Minecraft server plugin that allows players to battle in teams until there is only one team left.

Goldor Network was the company name that I came up with.

UHC stands for Ultra HardCore. UHC is a sort of mnemonic for a set of rules. Those rules are mainly that players do not regenerate health, which adds a new level of difficulty to the already challenging environment of Minecraft survival. 

With my plugin specifically, I made use of "Scenarios." (Mislabelled as "gamemodes" in the actual code- was too lazy to update this)

Scenarios introduce new challenges, such as players may only use a certain form of damage or that players not above a certain height are liable to take extra damage. 
Basically with Scenarios, I am manipulating the flow of the game and making players think differently about something that they are used to thinking about in one way. In other words, I am making the player exercise new forms of problem solving. 
The twist that I have really created on this existing gamemode (UHC) is that Scenarios are enabled at random. This adds a form of unpreparedness and novelty to an already existing idea.
