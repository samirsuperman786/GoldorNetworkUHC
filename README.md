So I have officially retired this project as of 7/30/2016. As such, I am making this public and offering all my source code in this
repository for anyone to freely use.

Good luck!

# What is GoldorNetworkUHC?

Goldor Network UHC is a Minecraft server plugin that allows players to battle in teams until there is only one team left.

Minecraft is a sandbox game where players can create anything they want by collecting blocks, or resources. Minecraft also includes various challenges such as mobs which are enemies that can damage players. The most important aspect of Minecraft is its Player versus Player feature. This is the main backbone of UHC. Player versus Player (PVP) allows players to damage and destroy other players and their creations. This introduces a major obstacle to the already established Player versus environment.

UHC stands for Ultra HardCore. UHC is a sort of mnemonic for a set of rules. Those rules are mainly that players do not regenerate health and that the only way to win is be the last team or player standing on the battle field. This adds a new level of difficulty on top of the already challenging environment of Minecraft survival. 

With my plugin specifically, I made use of "Scenarios." (Mislabelled as "gamemodes" in the actual code- was too lazy to update this)
Scenarios introduce new challenges, such as players may only use a certain form of damage or that players not above a certain height are liable to take extra damage. 
Basically with Scenarios, I am manipulating the flow of the game and making players think differently about something that they are used to thinking about in one way. In other words, I am making the player exercise new forms of problem solving. 
The twist that I have created on this existing gamemode (UHC) is that Scenarios are enabled at random. This adds a form of unpreparedness and novelty to an already existing idea.
